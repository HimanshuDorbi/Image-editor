Build An Image Editor in HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript



In this project (Image Editor in JavaScript), as youâ€™ve seen in the preview image, users can apply different filters to their image like grayscale, inversion, saturation, and adjust the image brightness. Additionally, users can also rotate or flip the images and save their edited images.

This project is made with vanilla JavaScript.
